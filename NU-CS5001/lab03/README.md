## Installation


* [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)


To install any of the above , use the link for your device's operating system and then follow the right prompts to install. 

- Since Visual Code is not an option to be downloaded from Anaconda navigator, After installing visual code, you would need to install the extension "Python extension for Visual Studio Code" as well as the extension "Anaconda". 

Then you would download the repository files. Then you would open terminal and type ```python3 filename``` . This will run Python on that file.
